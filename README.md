# jubeatIO
jubeatIO for official panels

## Pinout

Buttons go on these gpio :
`uint8_t buttonPin[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,A5,A4,A3,A2,A1};`

And are sourced this way from the IO PCBs

## Donation

If this project helps you and you want to give back, you can help me with my future projects.

While not necessary, donations are much appreciated and will only go towards funding future github projects (arcade hardware ain't cheap :( ).

Of course you'll also receive my gratitude and I'll remember you if you post a feature request ;)
